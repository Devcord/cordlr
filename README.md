> A discord bot using plugins created by the community.

Cordlr is a new way to create **customized Discord bots** tailored for your needs. You don't want that anime plugin? Don't install it. You need more management plugins? Install it! You want to change strings of a plugin? Do it in the configuration.

Everything in Cordlr is customizable and can be changed by everyone. Developers can create plugins which can be installed via drag-and-drop or NPM.

Sounds good? Lets get started!

**Requirements**
* Node.js 6.0 or higher
* *Recommendation* - [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) or [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever)
